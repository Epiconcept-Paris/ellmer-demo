Sensitivity tests showed resistance to co-amoxiclav, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin, with sensitivity to meropenem and amikacin. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a 5 cm intra-abdominal fluid collection in the right iliac fossa. CT abdomen confirmed a localized abscess adjacent to the cecum. WBC was 18.2 with neutrophilia, CRP 96, procalcitonin 6.5.

Examination and Investigations The ulcer measured approximately 3 cm in diameter over the plantar aspect of the left foot with surrounding erythema and mild seropurulent drainage. Peripheral pulses were palpable. Ankle-brachial pressure index was 1.1 bilaterally. WCC was 9.8 with no left shift. CRP was 35. Blood cultures taken on 18/03/2025 showed no growth at 48 hours. Wound swab isolated Streptococcus agalactiae, sensitive to co-amoxiclav and clindamycin. MRI foot showed no signs of osteomyelitis.
Clinical Course In consultation with the diabetic foot clinic, the patient was started on oral co-amoxiclav 625mg TDS. He was advised strict glycemic control and offloading measures. Podiatry performed debridement on 20/03/2025, and daily wound dressings were instituted. Improvement was noted with decreased erythema.

Clinical Details Ms. Jane Smith, a 72-year-old female known to have COPD and hypertension, presented on 04/01/2025 with increasing dyspnea, productive cough of thick yellow sputum, and fever of 38.5°C for the past two days. She was complaining of general weakness, reduced appetite, and confusion. On examination, she was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 94% on 3L nasal cannula. Blood pressure was 105/70 mmHg, heart rate was 120 bpm in sinus rhythm, and temperature was 38.4°C. Chest auscultation revealed reduced air entry in the right lower lobe with coarse crackles. She was noted to have pedal edema up to the ankles.

Sensitivity testing on 06/01/2025 indicated resistance to co-amoxiclav and cefuroxime, but sensitivity to piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem. Sputum culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae with a similar antibiotic profile.
Clinical Course She was initially started empirically on co-amoxiclav but was escalated to piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5g TDS IV upon culture results on 06/01/2025. Team of Dr. X (Respiratory) was consulted. The patient remained febrile, so therapy was upgraded to meropenem 1g TDS IV on 08/01/2025. Her confusion improved gradually, and fever subsided. Renal function was closely monitored due to concern for acute kidney injury. She required supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula for four days and showed clinical improvement. A repeat set of blood cultures on 10/01/2025 was negative. She was discharged on 14/01/2025 with a two-week course of oral ciprofloxacin 500mg BD as per ID recommendation and a follow-up chest X-ray booked for 21/02/2025.",Yes,Klebsiella pneumoniae,04/01/2025
